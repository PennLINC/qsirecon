*QSIRecon* outputs are organized according to BIDS Derivatives standards.

.. admonition:: A note on BIDS compliance

   *QSIRecon* attempts to follow the BIDS specification as closely as possible.
   However, many *QSIRecon* derivatives are not currently covered by the specification.
   In those instances, we attempt to follow recommendations from existing BIDS Extension Proposals
   (BEPs), which are in-progress proposals to add new features to BIDS.
   However, we do not guarantee compliance with any BEP,
   as they are not yet part of the official BIDS specification.

   Three BEPs that are of particular use in *QSIRecon* are
   `BEP016: Diffusion weighted imaging derivatives <https://bids-website.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/beps/bep_016.html>`_,
   `BEP017: Relationship & connectivity matrix data schema <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugBdUF6dhElXdj3u9vw0iWjE6f_Bibsro3ah7sRV0GA/edit?usp=sharing>`_,
   and
   `BEP038: Atlas Specification <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RxW4cARr3-EiBEcXjLpSIVidvnUSHE7yJCUY91i5TfM/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

   In cases where a derivative type is not covered by an existing BEP,
   we have simply attempted to follow the general principles of BIDS.

   If you discover a problem with the BIDS compliance of *QSIRecon*'s derivatives,
   please open an issue in the *QSIRecon* repository.
