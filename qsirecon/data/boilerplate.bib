  abstract     = {Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) estimates microstructural properties of brain tissue relating to the organisation and processing capacity of neurites, which are essential elements for neuronal communication. Descriptive statistics of NODDI tissue metrics are commonly analyzed in regions-of-interest (ROI) to identify brain-phenotype associations. Here, the conventional method to calculate the ROI mean weights all voxels equally. However, this produces biased estimates in the presence of CSF partial volume. This study introduces the tissue-weighted mean, which calculates the mean NODDI metric across the tissue within an ROI, utilising the tissue fraction estimate from NODDI to reduce estimation bias. We demonstrate the proposed mean in a study of white matter abnormalities in young onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD). Results show the conventional mean induces significant bias that correlates with CSF partial volume, primarily affecting periventricular regions and more so in YOAD subjects than in healthy controls. Due to the differential extent of bias between healthy controls and YOAD subjects, the conventional mean under- or over-estimated the effect size for group differences in many ROIs. This demonstrates the importance of using the correct estimation procedure when inferring group differences in studies where the extent of CSF partial volume differs between groups. These findings are robust across different acquisition and processing conditions. Bias persists in ROIs at higher image resolution, as demonstrated using data obtained from the third phase of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI); and when performing ROI analysis in template space. This suggests that conventional ROI means of NODDI metrics are biased estimates under most contemporary experimental conditions, the correction of which requires the proposed tissue-weighted mean. The tissue-weighted mean produces accurate estimates of ROI means and group differences when ROIs contain voxels with CSF partial volume. In addition to NODDI, the technique can be applied to other multi-compartment models that account for CSF partial volume, such as the free water elimination method. We expect the technique to help generate new insights into normal and abnormal variation in tissue microstructure of regions typically confounded by CSF partial volume, such as those in individuals with larger ventricles due to atrophy associated with neurodegenerative disease.}

In this study, Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the effect of using different gradient sampling schemes on estimates of tensor-derived quantities assuming a b-value of 1000 smm(-2). The study focused in particular on the effect that the number of unique gradient orientations has on uncertainty in estimates of tensor-orientation, and on estimates of the trace and anisotropy of the diffusion tensor. The results challenge the recently proposed notion that a set of six icosahedrally-arranged orientations is optimal for DT-MRI. It is shown that at least 20 unique sampling orientations are necessary for a robust estimation of anisotropy, whereas at least 30 unique sampling orientations are required for a robust estimation of tensor-orientation and mean diffusivity. Finally, the performance of sampling schemes that use low numbers of sampling orientations, but make efficient use of available gradient power, are compared to less efficient schemes with larger numbers of sampling orientations, and the relevant scenarios in which each type of scheme should be used are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) faces the challenging task of bringing multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities together in a common automated preprocessing framework across a large cohort of subjects. The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines.},

	abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological "atoms". Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data.
