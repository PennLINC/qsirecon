              is more beneficial to use a large number of gradient sampling
              orientations in diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) experiments than to
              use a smaller number of carefully chosen orientations. In this
              study, Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the effect of
              using different gradient sampling schemes on estimates of
              tensor-derived quantities assuming a b-value of 1000 smm(-2). The
              study focused in particular on the effect that the number of
              unique gradient orientations has on uncertainty in estimates of
              tensor-orientation, and on estimates of the trace and anisotropy
              of the diffusion tensor. The results challenge the recently
              proposed notion that a set of six icosahedrally-arranged
              orientations is optimal for DT-MRI. It is shown that at least 20
              unique sampling orientations are necessary for a robust estimation
              of anisotropy, whereas at least 30 unique sampling orientations
              are required for a robust estimation of tensor-orientation and
              mean diffusivity. Finally, the performance of sampling schemes
              that use low numbers of sampling orientations, but make efficient
              use of available gradient power, are compared to less efficient
              schemes with larger numbers of sampling orientations, and the
              relevant scenarios in which each type of scheme should be used are
              discussed.",
